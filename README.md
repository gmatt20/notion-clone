# Full Stack Notion-Style Application!

This project is a full stack Notion-style application, inspired by an industry-grade development process. While I initially referenced the Code With Antonio tutorial to get familiar with the stack — including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Convex for backend logic, and Clerk for authentication — my focus has gone far beyond replication.

Throughout the build, I’ve approached each component as an opportunity to learn core software engineering principles — including clean architecture, separation of concerns, reusable components, API design, and state management. I’ve taken the time to understand how these technologies interact, why certain patterns are used, and how to structure an application that is scalable, secure, and maintainable.

Rather than following step-by-step instructions, I’ve worked to internalize the reasoning behind each architectural decision, often pausing to experiment, refactor, and explore alternate implementations. After completing the core version, I’ll be extending the app with original features, UI/UX enhancements, and custom logic to make the project uniquely mine.

This isn’t just a clone — it’s a launchpad for mastering full stack development through real, applied learning. It is my foot-in-the-door into the world of full stack and start-up development. This project has been helping me tremoundsly in what real world development looks like, including the architecture to the services used. It is an awesome project!
